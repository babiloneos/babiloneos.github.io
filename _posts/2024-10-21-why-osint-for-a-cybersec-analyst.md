## Why OSINT?

During my day-by-day work, I've found myself strugling to find motivation on Cybersecurity.

Though it is a field that I love, and I really feel pasionate about, the day-by-day work with all operative and burocratic processes has been generating on me a lack of motivation to study, learn and even investigate about daily news.

Looking to change this, I start thinking on what I should do. Maybe I should force myself into a certification; Maybe a post-grade; Maybe giving my 200% in my job looking for a promotion. But none of them were really motivating me.

It wasn't until I noticed that detective series, and documentaries about policial investigations were really exciting for me, and I remebered that something a little similar exists in Cybersecurity: OSINT. And maybe that childish excitement could help me going back into my most motivated time, where all I wanted was to learn and practice all day long.

And I know, it isn't a really professional, or mature motiviation. But is there any motivation that works better than childish ones? Those are the more energetic, funny, and _easy_ to follow ones.

Ohh! But... 

## OSINT is not easy, is it?

Well, I need to find it out, and how would I find it out if I don't try it?

That's how, following my perfectionist and strict behaviour, I decided that I needed to find a structured path to introduce me into OSINT, and give this childish idea of mine a try.

I searched a lot. Youtube playlists, talks, hackboxes, online courses. Even academic alternatives.
And even though I found some very interesting ones, I decided to follow this with a book.

## Why a book?

My experience with technical books has been really good. I've read [_Linux Bible_](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/Linux_Bible/c-zGBwAAQBAJ) by Christopher Negus, the classic [_How to program with C/C++_](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/C%C3%B3mo_programar_en_C_C_++_y_Java/sWjcMGUAnXwC) by Deitel & Deitel, and even the [_Comptia Security+ guide_](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/CompTIA_Security+_SY0_601_Certification/fEUREAAAQBAJ) by Ian Neil. And with all of them I have felt a much better and structured learning than with online courses, and academic ones.

The only bad point that I see is the lack of phisical or digital evidence about me finishing those learning, as they doesn't provide any certificate of completition, or digital badge. But it is a cost that I can assume on this personal project.

## What book will I try?

I found two very interesting books for OSINT:

- [_OSINT Techniques: Resources for Uncovering Online Information_](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/OSINT_Techniques/-XuhzwEACAAJ). By Michael Bazzell
- [_Deep Dive: Exploring the Real-World Value of Open Source Intelligence_](https://www.google.com.mx/books/edition/Deep_Dive/SOa3EAAAQBAJ). By Rae L Baker

Both with very good reviews and with very interesting content. But I didn't want to really struggle and make of this decision a complex task. So I decided to read as much reviews as possible and go ahead with the book that more newbies recomend.

It was _Deep Dive: Exploring the Real-World Value of Open Source Intelligence_.

And don't worry, once I have completed this book, I will go with _OSINT Techniques: Resources for Uncovering Online Information_. But I needed something that helped me giving form in a peaceful way to my childish motivation.

That's it. I decided to start with this book, but after all of that, I needed somewhere to record all my adventure, learnings and findings. And that's where this blog cames into play.

So take a seat, and enjoy the movie. I will go on my own ryth, but for sure I will give my best.
